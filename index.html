<h1>Excel Training Program & Digital Workflow Prototype</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop a prototype for digitizing our company's data and workflows, beginning with Excel training and centralized data management. The objective is to increase productivity and enhance problem-solving capabilities across teams—particularly architects and related departments—who regularly use Excel but often lack structured tools or sufficient knowledge to utilize it effectively in their daily operations.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Develop a prototype system using Excel to support internal data handling.</li>
    <li>Build a training program focused on improving workflow through better Excel use.</li>
    <li>Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, especially in areas like requirement comparisons and area size projections.</li>
    <li>Deliver targeted Excel training to architecture and supporting departments.</li>
    <li>Measure improvements in workflow and data accuracy following training and tool implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<p>This project focuses on the design and delivery of a structured Excel training program tailored for architects and related departments. The scope includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Curriculum Development:</strong> Create a training syllabus covering key Excel concepts ranging from data cleaning and logic functions to pivot tables and basic dashboards.</li>
    <li><strong>Use-Case Alignment:</strong> Integrate real-world scenarios into the curriculum (e.g., requirement comparison, area projections, cost tracking) to ensure training relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop Delivery:</strong> Conduct hands-on training sessions (live or self-paced) designed to improve everyday efficiency and task accuracy.</li>
    <li><em>Workflow Assessment:</em> Identify recurring workflow issues Excel can address, and prototype spreadsheet tools or templates to solve them.</li>
    <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> This scope does not cover database implementation or external system integration at this stage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Excel Training Curriculum:</strong> A structured syllabus with learning outcomes, modules, and exercises.</li>
    <li><strong>Use-Case Worksheets:</strong> Functional Excel tools that directly implement relevant workflow use cases, such as requirement comparison and area projection calculators. These tools are intended for daily use, not just practice.</li>
    <li><em>Note:</em> While only requirement comparison and area projection calculators will be developed in this project, successful adoption may lead to future expansions such as cost tracking sheets or submission log trackers.</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop Materials:</strong> Slide decks, live demo files, and step-by-step guides.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow Issue Report:</strong> Document summarizing recurring inefficiencies identified during the training.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation & Feedback Summary:</strong> Compilation of participant feedback and training effectiveness metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Less reliance on manual file checking and visual comparisons</li>
    <li>Reusable templates for budgeting, comparison, and reporting</li>
    <li>Cross-team data sharing through structured Excel tools</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Training rollout (week 1–3)</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Collect feedback, measure impact, refine prototype (week 4–6)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion & Discussion</h2>
<p>This project lays the groundwork for larger-scale digital transformation.</p>
<p>By equipping team members with Excel skills and simple prototypes, we can establish a data-driven foundation that can be expanded with future tools (e.g., databases, dashboards, automation).</p>
<p>Further evaluation will determine whether to migrate from Excel to more robust systems (e.g., web-based apps or integrated databases) once workflows are mapped and improved.</p>
